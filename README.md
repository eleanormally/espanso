# espanso
My personal text expansion toolkit

## Setup

This is literally my espanso config folder. If you wish to copy my setup verbatim replace your config with this one. If you want to add to an existing espanso setup, each app in `config` is clearly labelled so use the ones you want, and put the scripts exactly like they are in a `match` folder. If you want expansion in every app, not only the one's specified in `config`, remove the `_` from the beginning of the `match` file names. The `_` tells espanso not to enable by default.

## Config

the `config` folder allows for app-specific use of shortcuts. 

## LaTeX

`match\_latex.yml` contains shortcuts that I use to speed up writing equations on my computer. While these are in no way standard, I find them immensely useful.

Some of these are regex functions. Those which end in an n-length regex string are terminated by pressing space (so don't put a space in the string itself)

## Obsidian

Hotkeys for the obsidian markdown app.
