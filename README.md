# espanso
My personal text expansion toolkit


## Config

the `config` folder allows for app-specific use of shortcuts. 

## LaTeX

`match\_latex.yml` contains shortcuts that I use to speed up writing equations on my computer. While these are in no way standard, I find them immensely useful.

Some of these are regex functions. Those which end in an n-length regex string are terminated by pressing space (so don't put a space in the string itself)

## Obsidian

Hotkeys for the obsidian markdown app.
